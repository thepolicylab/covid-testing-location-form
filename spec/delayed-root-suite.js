// We need a bit of extra time to collect our list of tests. Mocha
// provides a mechanism for this called the "delayed root suite",
// which is documented here:
//
//   https://mochajs.org/#delayed-root-suite
//
// Put simply, Mocha provides an extra global function called 'run'
// which we need to call manually once we're done loading any
// prerequistes needed for test collection to work. That's what
// this file is for.
